- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie

# How i solve the winner
- I created a function to check from the was player clicked on three squares in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row by if condition
- After each player role, I called the function

# How my favorite functions work
I defined a variable name is flag1 that refers on/off to the game, after the user click on the start game button it being called the function, In the first it checks for the game if off I called game function and change value flag 1 to 1
